### Configuration

To configure, please only edit the CONFIGURATION.php file in the root. No other files need to be touched.

You will see a couple of files in the root directory that look slightly odd. You DO NOT need to touch them however. Here is a quick explanation of them:

| File              |                                                                                                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| .htaccess         | This is a default override file for Apache servers. Heroku uses it as well.                                |
| .user.ini         | This is a default override on the memory limit for Heroku. This enables 19 PHP processes vs the default 4. |
| composer.json     | This is a configuration file for autoloading components.                                                   |
| composer.lock     | This is used for the composer.json. Don't touch this or the json, they've already been optimized for you.  |
| CONFIGURATION.php | This is the ONLY file you should touch. It holds all the settings for the status page.                     |
| index.php         | This is the main entry file that loads your configurations.                                                |
| Procfile          | This is a configuration file for Heroku that tells Heroku to use PHP.                                      |
| README.md         | This is the readme                                                                                         |
| /app/             | This is where the application logic is.          

You will never have to touch anything within the /app/ folder. If you are not using Heroku, your data will be stored in /app/data/

### Installing & Troubleshooting

#### php.ini configuration

If you are on PHP 5.6 and are recieving depreaction warning as following:

>Deprecated: Automatically populating $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. To avoid this warning set 'always_populate_raw_post_data' to '-1' in php.ini and use the php://input stream instead.


You will need to change your php.ini configuration to the following:
```
always_populate_raw_post_data=-1
```

----

### Server Configuration

#### Server requirements
- PHP 5.4+

#### Apache

You may need to add the following snippet in your Apache HTTP server virtual host configuration or **.htaccess** file.

```apacheconf
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/$1 [L]
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re lucky enough to be using a version of Apache greater than 2.2.15, then you can instead just use this one, single line:
```apacheconf
FallbackResource /index.php
```

#### IIS

For IIS you will need to install URL Rewrite for IIS and then add the following rule to your `web.config`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <rewrite>
          <rule name="Toro" stopProcessing="true">
            <match url="^(.*)$" ignoreCase="false" />
              <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll">
                <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" ignoreCase="false" negate="true" />
                <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" ignoreCase="false" negate="true" />
                <add input="{R:1}" pattern="^(index\.php)" ignoreCase="false" negate="true" />
              </conditions>
            <action type="Rewrite" url="/index.php/{R:1}" />
          </rule>
        </rewrite>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

#### Nginx

Under the `server` block of your virtual host configuration, you only need to add three lines.
```conf
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
}
```
